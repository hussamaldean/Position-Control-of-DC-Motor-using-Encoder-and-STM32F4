# Position-Control-of-DC-Motor-using-Encoder-and-STM32F4
Position Control of DC Motor using Encoder with STM32

Timer 2 is configured in encoder mode to read the pulses generated from the encoder (ENA->PA0, ENB->PA1).

The motor control pin is connected to PA5 and the LED is conected to PA6 

The code has been developed entrily using register manipulation using keil uVision developement enoviroment
